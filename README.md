# HabitTrove

HabitTrove is a gamified habit tracking application that helps you build and maintain positive habits by rewarding you with coins, which you can use to exchange for rewards.

> **⚠️ Important:** HabitTrove is currently in beta. Please regularly backup your `data/` directory to prevent any potential data loss.

## Docker Deployment

HabitTrove can be run using Docker in several ways, depending on your needs:

### Using Pre-built Images

The easiest way to run HabitTrove is using our pre-built Docker images from DockerHub:

1. First, prepare the data directory with correct permissions:

```bash
mkdir -p data backups
chown -R 1001:1001 data backups # Required for the nextjs user in container
```

2. Then run using either method:

```bash
# Generate a secure authentication secret
export AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
echo $AUTH_SECRET

# Using docker-compose (recommended)
## Update the AUTH_SECRET environment variable in [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/dohsimpson/HabitTrove/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml)
nano docker-compose.yaml
## Start the container
docker compose up -d

# Or using docker run directly
docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v ./data:/app/data \
  -v ./backups:/app/backups \ # Add this line to map the backups directory
  -e AUTH_SECRET=$AUTH_SECRET \
  dohsimpson/habittrove
```

Available image tags:

- `latest`: Stable release version, recommended for most users
- `vX.Y.Z` (e.g., `v0.1.4`): Specific version for reproducible deployments and rollbacks
- `dev`: Latest development build from the main branch, may contain unstable features

Choose your tag based on needs:

- Use `latest` for general production use
- Use version tags (e.g., `v0.2.9`) for reproducible deployments
- Use `dev` for testing new features

**Note on Volumes:** The application stores user data in `/app/data` and backups in `/app/backups` inside the container. The examples above map `./data` and `./backups` from your host machine to these container directories. Ensure these host directories exist and have the correct permissions (`chown -R 1001:1001 data backups`).

### Building Locally

If you want to build the image locally (useful for development):

```bash
# Build the Docker image
npm run docker-build

# Run the container
npm run docker-run
```

The application data will be persisted in the `data` directory in both cases.

## Building the Project

To contribute to HabitTrove, you'll need to set up a development environment. Here's how to get started:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or later
- npm package manager
- Git (for version control)
- bun (for running tests)

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dohsimpson/habittrove.git
cd habittrove
```

2. Install project dependencies:

```bash
npm install --force
```

3. Set up the development environment:

```bash
npm run setup:dev
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to access the development version.

### Running Tests

Before contributing, make sure to run the test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

### Building for Production

To build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized production build in the `.next` directory.

### Code Quality Tools

The project uses several tools to maintain code quality:

- ESLint for linting: `npm run lint`
- TypeScript type checking: `npm run typecheck`

Run these commands regularly during development to catch issues early.
