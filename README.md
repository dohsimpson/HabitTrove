# HabitTrove

HabitTrove is a gamified habit tracking application that helps you build and maintain positive habits by rewarding you with coins, which you can use to exchange for rewards.

> **⚠️ Important:** HabitTrove is currently in beta. Please regularly backup your `data/` directory to prevent any potential data loss.

## Docker Deployment

HabitTrove can be run using Docker in several ways, depending on your needs:

### Using Pre-built Images

The easiest way to run HabitTrove is using our pre-built Docker images from DockerHub:

1. First, prepare the data directory with correct permissions:

```bash
mkdir -p data
chown -R 1001:1001 data  # Required for the nextjs user in container
```

2. Then run using either method:

```bash
# Generate a secure authentication secret
export AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
echo $AUTH_SECRET

# Using docker-compose (recommended)
## update the AUTH_SECRET environment variable in docker-compose file
nano docker-compose.yaml
## start the container
docker compose up -d

# Or using docker run directly
docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v ./data:/app/data \
  -e AUTH_SECRET=$AUTH_SECRET \
  dohsimpson/habittrove
```

Available image tags:

- `latest`: Stable release version, recommended for most users
- `vX.Y.Z` (e.g., `v0.1.4`): Specific version for reproducible deployments and rollbacks
- `dev`: Latest development build from the main branch, may contain unstable features

Choose your tag based on needs:

- Use `latest` for general production use
- Use version tags (e.g., `v0.1.4`) for reproducible deployments
- Use `dev` for testing new features

### Building Locally

If you want to build the image locally (useful for development):

```bash
# Build the Docker image
npm run docker-build

# Run the container
npm run docker-run
```

The application data will be persisted in the `data` directory in both cases.
